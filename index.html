		<p class="overlay">I am a big proponent of single page applications and, as such, I prefer whenever possible to avoid scrolling to find content when this can be accomplished with a click / dropdown / search field. This is, however,  not always possible as the content itseld may, at times, extend beyond the bounds of the screen. In this situation I find that breaking up the monotony by using visual effects will maintain user engagement and aid in highlighting information. </p>

			<p>But using scripts to accomplish this can be buggy and taxing of resources. <br/> A more efficient way to is to leverage the browser's built in rendering engine by using CSS</p>
